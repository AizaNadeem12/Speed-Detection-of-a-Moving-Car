This project is implemented in Matlab. The implementation is basically done by finding two frames of video binarizing them and then finding there centre
of areas and then we find the distance between the centres of two binarized frames. The answer is then converted to 
meters per second which is displayed. Looking forward to getting good grade and marks. Thankyou.
